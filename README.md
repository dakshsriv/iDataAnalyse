# iDataAnalyse

This is a scientific, industrial, and more analysis software for LINUX os.

The input of this program is data received from TESS telescope which has a catalog of stars and their luminosity data available in XML and jpg formats. These images show graph of luminosity change over time.

The program processes the image and extracts information about the change in luminosity. Based on the trend, it makes an assessment what could have caused this change. Apart from just the reason, this program, can output other information like size of change, duration of change, etc.

This software doesn't just analyse luminosity of stars/time, it can do much more. You very briefly tell the criteria, and it will analyse your data for you if it's a graph.
